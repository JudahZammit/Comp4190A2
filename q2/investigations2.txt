We first split the data using a windowed absoluted deviation from the global mean absolute deviation.

Then we performed feature extraction on each data point instead of working with the original time series.

We considered three different sets of features:
-The features extracted from the EMG sensor
-The features extractide from the physical data sensors
-Both of the above

We found that traditional machine learning models, specificly tree based methods, perform just as well on the physical 
data as our neural network

However, for the EMG data, the neural network outperformed the tree based methods. This was true of using both
physical and EMG data, as well.

It is important to note that ALL methods achieved 100% accuracy on the test data. It was only 
in our 5-fold cross verification that any change in accuracy was observed.
