We do our data spliting in split.py
We do our feature extraction in feature_extraction.py
We split our data into train and test data in train_val.py
Our tree model is in tree.py
Our random forest model is in random_forest.py
Our neural network model is in nn.py

I suggest looking at presintation.pdf for nice visualizations of our program.
